/*
  # Fix delete function with complete RLS bypass
  
  1. Changes
    - Recreate function that completely bypasses RLS using row_security OFF
    - Use SECURITY INVOKER initially to get auth.uid()
    - Then switch to admin context for actual deletion
  
  2. Security
    - Validates user ownership before any deletion
    - Only deletes records owned by the authenticated user
